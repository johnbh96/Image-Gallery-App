# Image Gallery App using Flutter

This is a Flutter app that allows users to view images from links provided by the developer. The app consists of two screens: a list page that displays the images in a gallery grid and an image view page that displays the selected image in full screen mode. The app also includes a download button on the image view page, which enables users to download the image to their device.

To complete this project, you will need to:

- Build a Flutter app that displays images in a grid format on the list page.
- Create a second screen that displays the selected image in full screen mode.
- Add a download button to the image view page that allows users to download the selected image to their device.
- Handle API requests properly to load images from the provided links.
- Use state management to keep track of the app's state and display the downloading state in the mobile notification center.

## Guidelines

- Use Flutter's built-in widgets as much as possible to ensure that the app is performant and responsive.
- Use any state management solution that you are comfortable with (e.g., Provider, BLoC, etc.).
- Make sure that the app is easy to use and understand, with clear and concise UI/UX.
- Handle errors and exceptions gracefully to provide a good user experience.
- Write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.
- Follow the Flutter style guide (https://flutter.dev/docs/development/style-guide) for code formatting and organization.

## Bonus Features

If you finish the main requirements of the project and have time left over, you may consider adding some additional features to the app, such as:

- Implementing pagination to load more images as the user scrolls down the list.
- Allowing users to favorite images and view them in a separate screen.
- Adding animations and transitions to make the app more engaging.
- Implementing dark mode to provide a better user experience in low-light environments.
- Adding support for multiple languages to make the app accessible to a wider audience.
